I can understand key concepts of web design by seeing the code and knowing coding from my previous coding classes. 
I can identify the differences between team and Hugo with one being more focused toward talking to fellow students and the other for online posts. 
We have not done anything with content workflows 
I can identify key ways for content management by github all the files being organized makes it easy to know where all the posts we made will be 
I can use databases as previously taught in classes to look up information I may need for assignments.

This is a sample post. You can copy the text of this post to create new posts for your weekly learning reports. Pay close attention to the format of the text in this fileâ€”changing it too drastically will cause the report to not show up.
